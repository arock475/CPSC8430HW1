# HW1 ReadMe

In order to run these files and get the proper output you first have to ensure you have all of the correct packages downloaded

I utilized pytorch, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, and math in my programs

In order to run each of these programs you use the command 

```commandline
    arch -arm64 python3 file.py
```

Each of the files is run the same exact way. 

One caveat is that you may not need to run using arch -arm64, I had to do so since I was on an M1 MacBook and in order to run some of the matplotlib stuff this was the best fix I could find.

All training data is downloaded automatically in files that require it, no need to worry there.
(it is the CIFAR10 dataset, which you likely downloaded for other students already anyway)
